there are other read me files in the individual folders that explain what each program generally does
this one is to explain what is required to run the programs yourself





to use these programs you need to use python 3.12.6 or atleast a version simular to it, thats the version I have used.

you also need to download ollama and use the requests import to have python be able to interact with it


for putting the data of the protocol tests into a json file 
you also need the json import

I also used the import matplotlib and numpy to create graphs that may show correlations in the data
