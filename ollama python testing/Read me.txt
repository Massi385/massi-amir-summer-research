the python ollama program is the original program I used to test how to get ollama to work with pyton

ollama remember history is the same but the llm with be able to remember the history of the messages
i give it, it does that by returning a copy of the history with each prompt

ollama summarize history also remembers history but has the ai summarize each message before its added to
the history, making it so that the history will be shorter but contain necessary info for the llm
to remember past conversation history, since it summarizes the history will be shorter

2 ai talking is a test to have 2 ai talk back and forth each with different behavior prompts and
histories to simulate a real conversation

pals system 1 is a prototype of the pals system where the program simply asks the ai to come up with a 
queston on a given topic at a specific difficulty between 1-10. it will then ask the user for a  response
and ask the ai if the user was right or wrong then adjust difficulty from there
