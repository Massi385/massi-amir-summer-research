each program that starts with ollama is a program that simulates multiple conversations
between an ollama llm. there all the same except they use a different ollama model

theres 5 different scenarios, each is tested with 3 different tempuratures for the llm.
tempurature is a setting that determines how random or creative the llm can be


there are then 3 different checks for each message the ais return, each message is checked for 
sentiment, empathy, and coherence.

then each program makes a json file for all the data of each message, and a histories file
so i can read the actual conversations



the put data in csv file simply takes all 3 json files and makes a csv file thats organized

the graphchecks program looks through the data and creates graphs of ratings vs temp / model size / 
time in conversation to find correlations
